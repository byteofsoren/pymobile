# pymobile
This is a repository for an attempt to create an easy to use simulation environment that could be used for teaching mobile robotics.
## Modules implemented right now.
The `pycar.py` contains an simple graphical object that could be inherited of any object that should appear on the screen, like cars, wall, humans and what other else.
The other part of `pycar.py` is the render that renders the first object on the screen.
